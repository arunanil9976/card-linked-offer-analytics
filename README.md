# Card-linked-offer-analytics
End-to-end analysis of card-linked offers using SQL, Python, and Power BI to evaluate redemption, uplift, and campaign optimization opportunities.
# Card-Linked Offer Performance Analytics

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of card-linked offers by analyzing transaction behavior, redemption patterns, and spend uplift. The objective is to identify high-performing customer segments, merchants, and geographies to support data-driven campaign optimization.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL) – data extraction & aggregation
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – analysis & validation
- Power BI – interactive dashboards & storytelling

## Key Business Questions
- Do offers increase transaction value?
- Which customer segments redeem offers the most?
- Which merchants and cities perform best?
- How should future campaigns be optimized?

## Analysis Workflow
1. **SQL** – Cleaned and aggregated transaction data, calculated redemption rates and average spend
2. **Python** – Validated metrics, analyzed segment & city-level performance
3. **Power BI** – Built executive dashboards with insights and recommendations

- Redemption behavior varies by customer segment and city
- A small group of merchants consistently outperform others

## Recommendations
- Prioritize high-response customer segments and cities
- Focus investment on top-performing merchants
- Choose offer types based on cost efficiency, as spend impact is consistent

## Future Enhancements
- A/B testing framework for offer types
- Time-series analysis of campaign performance
- Predictive modeling for redemption likelihood
